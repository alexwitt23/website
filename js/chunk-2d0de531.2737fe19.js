I enjoy deep learning projects, pour over coffee, reading, and running. I will be staying at UT in 2021 to begin a Master&#39;s in Computer Science. </p><p class="text-start lh-base"> Computational Engineering is a combination of physics, math, engineering and numerical analysis. The applications are ubiquitous and often take form as computational fluid dynamics or finite element method. My education has focused on coupling physics with an understanding of the tradeoffs that come with using different numerical methods to solve physical systems. </p><p class="text-start lh-base"> While in school, I&#39;ve also worked as a machine learning engineer at TerraClear, an agricultural tech startup based in Bellevue, WA and Grangeville, ID. Placing emphasis on robust software and rapid model experimentation, I helped implement, train, and deploy state of the art AI models. I also integrated these models into a PyTorch-based inferencing application which currently produces the aerial maps at TerraClear. </p><p class="text-start lh-base"> Outside of class, I am a member of The Tau Beta Pi engineering honor society, where I served as historian for 2 years. I also lead the Image Recognition team within the software division at UAV Austin. </p><div class="d-flex justify-content-center"><button type="button" class="btn btn-dark">Resume Download</button></div></div></div></div></div>',1);function s(e,a,t,s,o,r){var l=Object(n["u"])("navbar");return Object(n["p"])(),Object(n["d"])(n["a"],null,[Object(n["g"])(l),i],64)}var o=t("64f9"),r={components:{navbar:o["a"]}};r.render=s;a["default"]=r}}]);
