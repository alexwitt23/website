I graduated from UT Austin in 2021 with a BS in\n              <a href=\"https://cockrell.utexas.edu/academics/computational-engineering\">\n              Computational Engineering</a>. Outside of school, I enjoy deep learning\n              projects, pour over coffee, non-fiction literature, and running.\n          </p>\n          <p class=\"text-start lh-base\">\n              Computational Engineering is a combination of physics, math, engineering and\n              numerical analysis. The applications are ubiquitous and often take form as\n              computational fluid dynamics or finite element method. My education has focused\n              on coupling physics with an understanding of the tradeoffs that come with using\n              different numerical methods to solve physical systems.\n          </p>\n          <p class=\"text-start lh-base\">\n              While in school, I've also worked as a machine learning engineer at TerraClear,\n              an agricultural tech startup based in Bellevue, WA and Grangeville, ID.\n              Placing emphasis on robust software and rapid model experimentation,\n              I helped implement, train, and deploy state of the art AI models. I also\n              integrated these models into a PyTorch-based inferencing application which\n              currently produces the aerial maps at TerraClear.\n          </p>\n          <p class=\"text-start lh-base\">\n              Outside of class, I am a member of The Tau Beta Pi engineering honor society,\n              where I served as historian for 2 years. I also lead the Image Recognition team\n              within the software division at UAV Austin.\n          </p>\n          <div class=\"d-flex justify-content-center\">\n              <button type=\"button\" onclick=\"location.href='https://forms.gle/GrpdviPYtpqyyQhn6'\"\n              class=\"btn btn-dark\">Resume Download</button>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\n\nimport NavBar from '../layouts/NavBar'\n\n\nexport default {\n  components: {\n    'navbar': NavBar\n  }\n}\n</script>\n","import { render } from \"./About.vue?vue&type=template&id=cc1d4160\"\nimport script from \"./About.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"\nexport * from \"./About.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"\nscript.render = render\n\nexport default script"],"sourceRoot":""}
